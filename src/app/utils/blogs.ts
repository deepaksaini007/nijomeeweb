Blockchain platform enables users to get high encryption over the data in such a way that it could be protected to get hacked or steal. Blockchain solutions offer such kind of services, so it becomes impossible to change the information by any miscellaneous person.</p>
    <p><strong>Important Concepts of blockchain technology</strong>:-</p>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Blocks</strong>:- Blockchain ledger or data resides under the blocks. The data is in 32-bit whole number which is also known as “<em>Nounce”.</em> Nounce generated dynamically and randomly when the block is created. This block generates a hash block header.</li>
    <li><strong>Nodes</strong>:- Under blockchain technology, we can define nodes as a kind of electronic storage in which copies of blockchain resides and maintain them to keep the functionality of the network proper. The network on which Each node has a copy of the block should be algorithmically approved and it should maintain transparency.</li>
    <li><strong>Miners</strong>:- Blockchain mining comes under it. In blockchain technology, every block has its own unique hash which is referred to as the hash of the previous block in the blockchain. Block mining is not easy so it requires very complex math logic to break down blockchain solutions to generate an acceptable hash.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><em>Many of you have heard about the very famous term in blockchain technology Bitcoin and also assume bitcoin and blockchain as a single term. But in actual it’s not the right case. Bitcoin is a currency that is based on BlockChain technology and block-chain frameworks</em></p>
    <p><em>Bitcoin technology is a digital currency, which works on peer to peer bitcoin network. No need for any intermediate transactional process in between. Transactional nodes are highly verified by cryptography and recorded as a public distributed ledger called a blockchain.</em></p>
    <p>&nbsp;<strong>Let's see a few advantages of BlockChain:</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <ol>
    <li>High security</li>
    <li>Transaction Transparency</li>
    <li>Cost Reduction</li>
    <li>Better Traceability</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>5. Virtual Reality &amp; Augmented Reality</strong> <strong>(VR/AR):</strong>&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>What<strong> </strong>if you asked someone a blueprint of your home and he puts a complete virtual model in front of your eyes so you can feel what exactly your home is going to be looked at externally as well as internally. You may wonder how, but believe me, it is possible with AR/VR technologies.</p>
    <p>The term “<strong>Virtual Reality</strong>” and “<strong>Augmented Reality</strong>”&nbsp; is regularly growing a lot these days and also the demand for AR/VR experts are increasing widely. Though they both look the same in actual they are different. Let us look into it one by one and see what characteristics distinguish them.</p>
    <ol>
    <li>
    <p><strong>Virtual Reality:</strong>&nbsp;Shutting down the real/physical world and taking people into an experience where they can actually feel the imaginary/virtual environment live in front of their eyes. With the help of VR devices like HTC Vive which Completely implies the virtual existence in such a way to give a real vibe to any person so they can feel currently present at the situation or frame running in front of their eyes.</p>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Augment Reality:</strong>&nbsp;Giving a live view of an element by adding digital interfaces or models so that a person can imagine live activities happening on themselves with the use of cameras or smartphones Is what comes into augmented reality.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
    </ol>
    <p>After AR / VR we also have 2 more things that are still coming into the picture i.e <strong>Mixed Reality(MR), Extended Reality(XR).</strong> So, now you are very much aware of AR/VR technologies and if you feel like that you can play with things and found your interest to give real vibes with digital elements, AR/VR is a very good opportunity for a great career.</p>
    <p><strong>6. Edge Computing:&nbsp;</strong>In IT everything rotates among data and on the web there is plenty of data available. For each organization, the most important thing is its data and its security.</p>
    <p>If you have heard about the term ”<strong><a href="https://www.nijomee.com/nijomee-blogs/data-warehouse-and-its-concepts" target="_blank">Data Warehousing</a> </strong>”, you will be enough familiar with the data processing and response time to fetch data from the servers and storing the back. We know higher processing and response optimization is a key demand, if your servers are situated miles away and providing very low response then automatically you will not get entertained by optimal speed and time utilization. So, to rescue this<strong> EDGE COMPUTING</strong> comes into the picture.<strong> </strong></p>
    <p>Edge computing is already in use but only by some organizations. According to a study, the demand for edge computing is going to increase very much in near future. Edge computing allows the bringing of computational services closer to the customer or its end-user, to make sure they do not face any kind of time gap issues. For example, if you are doing a video streaming and after every few seconds you got a loader on your screen, finally you would get fed up and stop the video. This thing also affects your user experience. To overcome these companies establish their data center near your location and all the processing will be done at that endpoint only.</p>
    <p>To manage things like this with the help of IoT and mobile computing technologies companies are setting up their local server for computation, rather than transmitted to a data center. Due to the daily increase in demand Edge computing is one of the great career opportunities for IT students.&nbsp;</p>

    {id:2,category:'other',heading:'Data Warehouse and its concepts',description:`</p><p>Welcome to another blog by Nijomee Technologies. Before &nbsp;getting started let me introduce to who we are. Nijomee Technologies is a Software and App development company in Rohtak, Haryana. We have bee developing best Android and IOS app development solutions over the globe.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Along with delivering our services to small to big business enterprises, we are very much inclined towards building great minds and providing right guidance to make them future ready industry experts.</p>
    <p><em>In this blog we are going to discuss about Data Warehousing concepts. Let’s first start with Data warehousing definition</em>.</p>
    <p>“<em><strong>Data Warehousing in the process of managing and storing data coming from multiple servers or location into a large size electronic storage device</strong></em>”<br>
    &nbsp;<br>
    A data warehouse schema is not like general operational databases, it is maintained separately by the organizations which is used by Business Intelligence professionals to analyze the data residing inside it. Data warehousing architecture is designed in such a way so that data can be fetched from different sources connected with data warehousing DBMS and generating meaningful reports from the data .These reports are used by companies to make future business decisions. That’s why we a data ware is also called as “<strong>Decision Support System</strong>”.<br>
    In generally, Data warehousing helps to ease the process of analytic and reporting in any organization. Data warehousing applications act as the single spot from which companies can apply Data mining concepts as well as decision making &amp; future prediction process.</p>
    <p><strong>Let’s see the other general terms use for data warehousing:</strong></p>
    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; • Decision Support System<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; • Business Intelligence solution system<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; • Executive support system</p>
    <p><strong>Need for Data-warehousing:</strong></p>
    <p>We know that a huge amount of data is flowing over the internet and data is the most most important asset of any organization as it helps companies to get meaningful business insights. But you may wonder why don’t companies use existing operational databases directly and why data warehousing is used.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Operational databases stores petabytes of data and each database stores a respective type fo data .For this multiple databases are needed to be maintained by companies. But when needs comes fetching data for any analytical operations it becomes very time consuming to get data from multiple data sources. Also Due to the emergence of Cloud Computing, organizations data sources have been located at far locations so sometimes it becomes complicated to execute query on each data source to get needed data out of them. To resolve time consumptions “Data-warehousing” comes into picture.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>A data warehouse is usually implemented in a single RDBMS which acts as a centralized storage. From Different sources data is Extracted and store into a single place. It helps user to perform data warehousing ETL operations easily.when ever data is needed to generate insights &nbsp;by BI people they can perform query and needful actions on the data-warehouse and build report.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;<strong>Types of Data Stored into Data-warehouse :</strong></p>
    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; • Structured Data<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; • Unstructured Data<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; • Semi-Structured Data</p>
    <p><strong>Data warehousing types:</strong><br>
    &nbsp;<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; • Enterprise Data warehouse<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; • Operational Data store<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; • Data Mart</p>
    <p><strong>Data-warehousing Components :</strong></p>
    <p><img alt="data-warehouse-componets" class="img-fluid" src="https://nijomee.com/assets/blog/data-warehouse-componets.png"></p>
    <p><strong>A Data-warehouse is comprises of 4 components which are defined as following:</strong></p>
    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; • Central data-warehouse Databases<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; • Data integration<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; • Meta Data<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; • Data-warehouse accessible tools&nbsp;</p>
    <p>These data warehousing components are designed to speed up the query process and getting quick results for analyzing data at real-time. Let’s look into them one by one.&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong> </strong></p>
    <p><strong>1. Central data-warehouse Database :&nbsp;</strong>A central component where all the organization data is stored for the further analysis and reporting process. This central db component is chosen by the organization in which format they want to store the data. For example :-</p>
    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;•&nbsp;&nbsp;If you want to store in RDMS than MS SQL Server, Oracle , SAP can be used.<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;•&nbsp;&nbsp;If &nbsp;Analytical databases like Teradata can be used if data is stored &nbsp;and managed for analysis.<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;•&nbsp;&nbsp;Organization can also prefer cloud platforms like AWS, MS Azure if they want to reduce hardware costs.</p>
    <p><strong>2. Data Ingestion :&nbsp;</strong>This process includes data warehousing ETL operations. ETL stands for Extract, Transform, Load. With the help of ETL tools user can extract data from different data sources, transform them , do required data aggregations to make data into a suitable pattern or in a organized form and load the data into data warehouse.&nbsp;</p>
    <p><br>
    <strong>3. Meta Data :</strong>&nbsp;Meta data means Data about data. Data warehousing Meta data in data warehouse DBMS helps to determine the framework of the residing data. It helps in handling and making use of data much easier as it explains what kind of data is storing inside the warehouse, Which helps developers and business intelligence people to make meaningful decisions from them.&nbsp;</p>
    <p><br>
    <strong>4. Data Warehousing Tools :&nbsp;</strong>Users can not have direct assess to the database or group of database &nbsp;by which a data-warehouse is designed or build up. User can not directly access the data, so for this some accessibility providing tools are used which help users &nbsp;to perform the required actions in a very convenient and optimized way like Data Mining, Report generation, Query and transaction implementations etc&nbsp;<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Some of data warehousing tools are :</strong><br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; •&nbsp; Micro Focus Vertica<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; •&nbsp; Tera Data<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; •&nbsp; Amazon DynamoDB<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; •&nbsp; PostgreSQL<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; •&nbsp; SAP HANA<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; •&nbsp; Amazon Redshift<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; •&nbsp; IBM Db2 Warehouse<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; •&nbsp; Snow Flake<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; •&nbsp; Google Big Query</p>
    <p>All these components are used to access and perform operations on data-warehouse.</p>
    <p><strong>Data warehousing applications:</strong>&nbsp;Let’s llok over some industries where Data-warehousing applications can be used.</p>
    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; •&nbsp; Health care&nbsp;<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; •&nbsp; Insurance<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; •&nbsp; Telecommunication<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; •&nbsp; Banking<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; •&nbsp; Manufacturing</p>
    <p><strong>Benefits of Data Warehousing</strong><br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; •&nbsp; Saves Time<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; •&nbsp; Fast data retrieving<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; •&nbsp; Helps in improving decision making processes<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; •&nbsp; Hight data consistency<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; •&nbsp; Enhanced data quality<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; •&nbsp; Organized information flow<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; •&nbsp; Streamlined data warehousing etl operations<br>

    {id:3,category:'other',heading:'7 Key Elements of Successful Goal Achievement',description:`</p><p>There is a justified statement “<strong><em>Every pro was once a noob</em></strong>” which applies to everyone to whom you believe your inspiration.</p>
    <p>What is more important to survive? Money or knowledge. Any wise person will say Both and he is right but probably not completely. If I were asking this question I would like to start</p>
    <p><em>“<strong>Important is what doesn’t makes us tired and motivate to put more effort if we fail</strong>.”</em></p>
    <p>The curious point where everyone gets confused is What really makes you happy and motivated. Is what you are doing really your potential? Or you are also following something blindly “<em>what everyone is doing</em>”</p>
    <p>This era of living is not made for those who don’t think of what they want to do, This is the era of uniqueness, being wise and intelligent. No one is going to help you out if get failed in the race of life</p>
    <blockquote>
    <h3><span class="marker"><strong>Sympathy is everywhere, support is rare.</strong></span></h3>
    </blockquote>
    <p><strong>Choose your path. A path which is made by you, your own efforts, your own way of leading life.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Oh!! Don’t get into too much confusion and overthinking </strong></p>
    <p>This blog will cover some key steps to success that can direct you towards a decision-making mind.</p>
    <p><strong>Planning:</strong> The most first step for goal achievement is planning. Always said A mind with a plan is more powerful than a mind with knowledge and without a plan. Before starting any journey you should plan the path to reach your destiny. A perfect plan helps you to analyze the upcoming challenges and their solutions. Making a road map and plan accordingly is the very first step towards your goal.</p>
    <p><strong>Resource Collection: </strong>You must know Where to start and what to do. A plan is only a blueprint of your idea but Resources that will lead your efforts into actual output are very much necessary. A person must have all the needed resources to kick start his work.</p>
    <p><strong>Organization:</strong>&nbsp;The third and the structure making process to achieve anything is Organizing things into the right position before coming to actual preparations. A person should have a structures based approach to do anything. Time Management is the best example of a work Organization.</p>
    <p><strong>Preparation:</strong>&nbsp;This includes all your dedication and focuses on the idea or work to make your knowledge base improved. Preparation never means only 4 -5 hours of working efforts but it includes every moment of your life thinking about the process until it comes into execution.</p>
    <p><strong>Execution: </strong>Now that you have a plan, resources, organization, and knowledge. It's time to give yourself a kick start.</p>
    <p><strong>If Failure: </strong>You can either fail or pass. but if fail, don't forget Failures are part of every success Journey. Yes, you will be upset and depressed. I completely understand you, It has happened to me many times and it happens to everyone. Nothing new in gaol achievement, but the only person who has the guts to improve his mistakes and get up again to complete his challenge for work is the real WINNER.</p>
    <p><strong>Revise your preparation and execution process: </strong>Now your task is to figure out where you lose and what wrong you have done in your whole success roadmap. This will include your revision from the planning process to Execution.</p>
    <p><strong>Try Again until you achieve: </strong>This time try harder than before. Put your leg more strongly. Your career objective should be more clear now. Your success path should not involve distractions. Always remember “A Loin with wounds is more dangerous than any other animal in the jungle” and this world is the biggest jungle where everyone is hungry and wants to cut others' way to reach food and fill their stomach.</p>
    <p>The above-mentioned 7 key elements to success are not goal specific but you can apply these strategy plannings in each task. Your career objective, goals, achievements always include wins and losses. You should focus on the next attempt by learning through the mistakes and move ahead.</p>
